### Creating Pull Requests
Before sending a Pull Request with significant changes, please use the [issue tracker][issues] to discuss the potential improvements you want to make.

OpenLineage uses [GitHub's fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/)
to create a contribution.

Every contribution is signed to say that the contributor has the rights to make the contribution and

## Proposing changes

Create an issue and prefix the description with "[PROPOSAL]"

In the description provide the following sections:
 - Purpose (Why?): What is the use case this is for. 
 - Proposed implementation (How?): Quick description of how do you propose to implement it. Are you proposing a new facet?

This can be just a couple paragraphs to start with.

## First-Time Contributors
