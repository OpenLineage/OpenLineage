# Versioning

## Context

The OpenLineage spec gets versioned and published.

Requirements:

- The OpenLineage spec and related libraries are in the OpenLineage repo.
- The OpenLineage spec version changes only when the spec itself changes.
- The libraries in the repo change more frequently than the spec (including when the spec changes).
- We want to version the OpenLineage spec independently of the API spec.
- The mechanism to version and publish the OpenLineage core spec applies to publishing custom facets.

## Mechanism

- The spec defines its current version using the `“$id”` field:
  - See:
    - [json schema core doc](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.8.2.1)
    - [Json schema spec $id](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema)
    - [also on github](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/blob/draft-next/meta/core.json)
  - Example: `"$id": "https://openlineage.io/spec/1-0-0/OpenLineage.json"` The URL in $id is resolvable and returns that
    version of the spec. We use github pages to publish the spec to openlineage.io
- The $id urls uses a SEMVER compliant version, following the
  [SCHEMAVER semantics](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/iglu/common-architecture/schemaver/)
  MODEL-REVISION-ADDITION
  - MODEL when you make a breaking schema change which will prevent interaction with any historical data
  - REVISION when you introduce a schema change which may prevent interaction with some historical data
  - ADDITION when you make a schema change that is compatible with all historical data

## Implementation Plan

- CI verifies that:
  - The $id field has the right domain prefix.
  - The version changes when the spec changes: When resolving “$id”, the build fails if the spec is not exactly the
    same.
  - The version does not change when the spec does not change. We can verify that the current version of the spec is not
    already published with a different version.
  - Libraries are generating events with the current version.
  - The spec is backward-compatible (only add optional fields) and consistent with the versioning semantics.
- git pre commit: Increments the versions automatically when the spec changes.
- Spec publication:
  - CI publishes to github pages when the $id changes on main (when this particular URL does not exist yet).
  - CI tags main with OpenLineage.json-{version}.
