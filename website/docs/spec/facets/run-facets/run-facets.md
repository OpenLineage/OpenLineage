# Run Facets

Run Facets apply to a specific `instance` of a particular running _job_. Every run will have a uniquely identifiable `run ID` that is usually a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), that can later be tracked. It is recommended to use [UUIDv7](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis/) version of the format.
