# Job Facets

Job Facets apply to a distinct instance of a job: an abstract `process` that consumes, executes, and produces datasets (defined as its inputs and outputs). It is identified by a `unique name` within a `namespace`. The *Job* evolves over time and this change is captured during the job runs.
