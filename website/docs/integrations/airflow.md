The OpenLineage and Apache Airflow integration has been relocated to the official OpenLineage Airflow Provider.

- **For Airflow 2.7 and newer**: Please refer to the native [OpenLineage provider documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/index.html)
- **For Airflow versions earlier than 2.7**: Use the [OpenLineage documentation for version **1.41**](https://openlineage.io/docs/1.41.0/integrations/airflow/), which was the last release supporting those Airflow versions. **This legacy integration is no longer maintained and will not receive any bug fixes, security updates, or new features.**
