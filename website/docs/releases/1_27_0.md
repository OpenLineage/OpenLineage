### Added
  
  * **Flink: Experimental version for flink native lineage listener.** [`#3099`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3099) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)
    *New flink listener to extract lineage through native Flink interfaces. Supports Flink SQL. Requires Flink 2.0.*
  * **dbt: add support for consuming dbt structured logs for test and build commands .** [`#3362`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3362) [@MassyB](https://github.com/MassyB)
    *New option for dbt integration now can handle test and build commands too.*
  * **Spark: allow attaching custom facets to RDDExecContext events.** [`#3379`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3379) [@ssanthanam185](https://github.com/ssanthanam185)
    *Events emitted from RDDExecutionContext now include custom facets that get loaded as part of InternalHandlerFactory.*
  * **spec: add DatasetTypeDatasetFacet.** [`#3390`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3390) [@ssanthanam185](https://github.com/ssanthanam185)
    *Events emitted from RDDExecutionContext now include custom facets that get loaded as part of InternalHandlerFactory.*
  
  ### Changed
  
  * **Python: allow adding additionalProperties to Python facets** [`#3391`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3391) [@JDarDagran](https://github.com/JDarDagran)
    *Adds `with_additonal_properties` method that allows to create modified instance of facet with additional properties.*
  * **Spark: allow attaching custom facets to RDDExecContext events.** [`#3379`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3379) [@ssanthanam185](https://github.com/ssanthanam185)
    *Events emitted from RDDExecutionContext now include custom facets that get loaded as part of InternalHandlerFactory.*
  * **Spark: SerializedFromObject events aren't filtered for not-delta plans.** [`#3403`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3403) [@ssanthanam185](https://github.com/ssanthanam185)
    *Those events shouldn't be filtered outside Databricks/Delta ecosystem.*
  
  ### Fixed
  * **Spark: fixed ClassLoader handling for OpenLineageExtensionProvider.** [`#3368`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3368) [@ddebowczyk92](https://github.com/ddebowczyk92)
    *Fixes ClassNotFoundException issue when using the openlineage-spark integration alongside a Spark connector that implements the spark-extension-interfaces due to class loader conflicts.*
  * **SQL: add minimal support for Snowflake LATERAL.** [`#3368`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3368) [@cisenbe](https://github.com/cisenbe)
    *SQL parser won't error on Snowflake's LATERAL keyword.*
  * **dbt: handle errors in parse_assertions** [`#3311`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3311) [@dsaxton-1password](https://github.com/dsaxton-1password)
    *dbt integration won't fail when looking at tests on seeds.*
  * **Spark: fix infinite loop in RDD flatten & perf optimization.** [`#3379`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3379) [@ssanthanam185](https://github.com/ssanthanam185)
    *Spark integration now correctly handles complex jobs that have cycles and nested RDD trees.*
  * **Python: FileTransport now correctly attaches `json` file extension.** [`#3404`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3404) [@kacpermuda](https://github.com/kacpermuda)
