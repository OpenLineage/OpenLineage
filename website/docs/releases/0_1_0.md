# 0.1.0 - 2021-08-13

OpenLineage is an _Open Standard_ for lineage metadata collection designed to record metadata for a job in execution. The initial public release includes:

* **An initial specification.** The the initial version [`1-0-0`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/blob/0.1.0/spec/OpenLineage.md) of the OpenLineage specification defines the core model and facets.
* **Integrations** that collect lineage metadata as OpenLineage events:
  * [`Apache Airflow`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/airflow) with support for BigQuery, Great Expectations, Postgres, Redshift, Snowflake
  * [`Apache Spark`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/spark)
  * [`dbt`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/dbt)
* **Clients** that send OpenLineage events to an HTTP backend. Both [`java`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/client/java) and [`python`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/client/python) are initially supported.
