# 1.22.0 - 2024-09-05

### Added
* **SQL: add support for `USE` statement with different syntaxes** [`#2944`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2944) [@kacpermuda](https://github.com/kacpermuda)  
    *Adjusts our Context so that it can use the new support for this statement in the parser and pass it to a number of queries.*
* **Spark: add script to build Spark dependencies** [`#3044`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3044) [@arturowczarek](https://github.com/arturowczarek)  
    *Adds a script to rebuild dependencies automatically following releases.*
* **Website: versionable docs** [`#3007`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3007) [`#3023`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3023) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Adds a GitHub action that creates a new Docusaurus version on a tag push, verifiable using the openlineage-site repo. Implements a monorepo approach in a new `website` directory.*

### Fixed
* **SQL: add support for `SingleQuotedString` in `Identifier()`** [`#3035`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3035) [@kacpermuda](https://github.com/kacpermuda)  
    *Single quoted strings were being treated differently than strings with no quotes, double quotes, or backticks.*
* **SQL: support `IDENTIFIER` function instead of treating it like table name** [`#2999`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2999) [@kacpermuda](https://github.com/kacpermuda)  
    *Adds support for this identifier in SELECT, MERGE, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. For now, only static identifiers are supported. When a variable is used, this table is removed from lineage to avoid emitting incorrect lineage.*
* **Spark: fix issue with only one table in inputs from SQL query while reading from JDBC** [`#2918`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2918) [@Imbruced](https://github.com/Imbruced)  
    *Events created did not contain the correct input table when the query contained multiple tables.*
* **Spark: fix AWS Glue jobs naming for RDD events** [`#3020`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3020) [@arturowczarek](https://github.com/arturowczarek)  
    *The naming for RDD jobs now uses the same code as SQL and Application events.*
