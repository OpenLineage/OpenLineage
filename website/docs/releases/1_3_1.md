# 1.3.1 - 2023-10-03

### Added
* **Airflow: add some basic stats to the Airflow integration** [`#1845`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1845) [@harels](https://github.com/harels)   
    *Uses the statsd component that already exists in the Airflow codebase and wraps the section that emits to event with a timer, as well as emitting a counter for exceptions in sending the event.*
* **Airflow: add columns as schema facet for `airflow.lineage.Table` (if defined)** [`#2138`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2138) [@erikalfthan](https://github.com/erikalfthan)     
    *Adds columns (if set) from `airflow.lineage.Table` inlets/outlets to the OpenLineage Dataset.*
* **DBT: add SQLSERVER to supported dbt profile types** [`#2136`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2136) [@erikalfthan](https://github.com/erikalfthan)  
    *Adds support for dbt-sqlserver, solving [#2129](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/issues/2129).*
* **Spark: support for latest 3.5** [`#2118`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2118) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Integration tests are now run on Spark 3.5. Also upgrades 3.3 branch to 3.3.3. Please note that `delta` and `iceberg` are not supported for Spark `3.5` at this time.*

### Fixed
* **Airflow: fix find-links path in tox** [`#2139`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2139) [@JDarDagran](https://github.com/JDarDagran)     
    *Fixes a broken link.*
* **Airflow: add more graceful logging when no OpenLineage provider installed** [`#2141`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2141) [@JDarDagran](https://github.com/JDarDagran)  
    *Recognizes a failed import of `airflow.providers.openlineage` and adds more graceful logging to fix a corner case.*
* **Spark: fix bug in PathUtils' prepareDatasetIdentifierFromDefaultTablePath(CatalogTable) to correctly preserve scheme from CatalogTable's location** [`#2142`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2142) [@d-m-h](https://github.com/d-m-h)   
    *Previously, the `prepareDatasetIdentifierFromDefaultTablePath` method would override the scheme with the value of "file" when constructing a dataset identifier. It now uses the scheme of the `CatalogTable`'s URI for this. Thank you @pawel-big-lebowski for the quick triage and suggested fix.*
