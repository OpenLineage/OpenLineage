# 1.28.0 - 2025-02-07

### Added

* **Java: enable specifying custom SSL context** [`#3444`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3444) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)
  *Enable providing configuration for SSL context within HTTP transport.*
* **Spark: make Spark nodes filtering configurable.** [`#3442`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3442) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)
  *Spark integration filters OpenLineage events for specific plan node classes. This can be now extended with extra config entries: `allowedSparkNodes` and `deniedSparkNodes`. See [Spark Configuration documentation](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/spark/configuration/spark_conf) for more details.*
* **Java: add task queue based async circuit breaker.** [`#3437`](https://github.com/`OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3437) [@aritrabandyo](https://github.com/aritrabandyo)
  *This circuit breaker that executes task on a queue backed threadpool, gives up tasks if the queue is full, and keeps track of rejected tasks.*
* **dbt: added initial support for Trino adapter** [`#3429`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3429) [@whitleykeith](https://github.com/whitleykeith)
  *This allows Trino integration to emit proper events containing Trino datasets.*
* **Spark: increased coverage for Spark DML commands** [`#3430`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3430) [@ssanthanam185](https://github.com/ssanthanam185)
  *Adds coverage for AlterTableRecoverPartitionsCommandVisitor, RefreshTableCommandVisitor, RepairTableCommandVisitor.*

### Changed

* **Spark: the OpenLineageSparkListener was refactored to have a public, single-argument constructor taking an instance of SparkConf.** [`#3425`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3425) [@d-m-h](https://github.com/d-m-h)
  *This presents no functional change to the listener, however it will allow for improved initialisation of the listener in the future.*
* **Spark: Unsupported catalog exception should be less verbose.** [`#3435`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3435) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)
  *In case of unsupported classes, `warn` logs without a stacktrace should be produced.*
* **Spark: Directly expose the LogicalPlan and SparkPlan objects inside OpenLineageContext.** [`#3443`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3443) [@d-m-h](https://github.com/d-m-h)
  *This is an initial refactor to a larger code base change that will see the removal of direct access of the QueryExecution object. It has no functional change on the way the integration behaves.*

### Fixed

* **Spark: improve column lineage by including inputs within `COMPLETE` events.** [`#3434`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3434) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)
  *Send input datasets in `COMPLETE` events while making sure version facet is attached on `START` only.
* **dbt: ParentRunFacet is now correctly attached when using structured logs option.** [`#3432`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3432) [@MassyB](https://github.com/MassyB)
  *Fixes incorrect structure of ParentRunFacet.*
