# 0.13.0 - 2022-08-22

### Added

* Add BigQuery check support [`#960`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/960) [@denimalpaca](https://github.com/denimalpaca)  
    *Adds logic and support for proper dynamic class inheritance for BigQuery-style operators. (BigQuery's extractor needed additional logic to support the forthcoming `BigQueryColumnCheckOperator` and `BigQueryTableCheckOperator`.)*
* Add `RUNNING` `EventType` in spec and Python client [`#972`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/972) [@mzareba382](https://github.com/mzareba382)  
    *Introduces a `RUNNING` event state in the OpenLineage spec to indicate a running task and adds a `RUNNING` event type in the Python API.*
* Use databases & schemas in SQL Extractors [`#974`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/974) [@JDarDagran](https://github.com/JDarDagran)  
    *Allows the Airflow integration to differentiate between databases and schemas. (There was no notion of databases and schemas when querying and parsing results from `information_schema` tables.)*
* Implement Event forwarding feature via HTTP protocol [`#995`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/995) [@howardyoo](https://github.com/howardyoo)  
    *Adds `HttpLineageStream` to forward a given OpenLineage event to any HTTP endpoint.*
* Introduce `SymlinksDatasetFacet` to spec [`#936`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/936) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Creates a new facet, the `SymlinksDatasetFacet`, to support the storing of alternative dataset names.*
* Add Azure Cosmos Handler to Spark integration [`#983`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/983) [@hmoazam](https://github.com/hmoazam)  
    *Defines a new interface, the `RelationHandler`, to support Spark data sources that do not have `TableCatalog`, `Identifier`, or `TableProperties` set, as is the case with the Azure Cosmos DB Spark connector.*
* Support OL Datasets in manual lineage inputs/outputs [`#1015`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1015) [@conorbev](https://github.com/conorbev)  
    *Allows Airflow users to create OpenLineage Dataset classes directly in DAGs with no conversion necessary. (Manual lineage definition required users to create an `airflow.lineage.entities.Table`, which was then converted to an OpenLineage Dataset.)* 
* Create ownership facets [`#996`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/996) [@julienledem](https://github.com/julienledem)  
    *Adds an ownership facet to both Dataset and Job in the OpenLineage spec to capture ownership of jobs and datasets.*

### Changed
* Use `RUNNING` EventType in Flink integration for currently running jobs [`#985`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/985) [@mzareba382](https://github.com/mzareba382)  
    *Makes use of the new `RUNNING` event type in the Flink integration, changing events sent by Flink jobs from `OTHER` to this new type.*
* Convert task objects to JSON-encodable objects when creating custom Airflow version facets [`#1018`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1018) [@fm100](https://github.com/fm100)  
    *Implements a `to_json_encodable` function in the Airflow integration to make task objects JSON-encodable.*

### Fixed
* Add support for custom SQL queries in v3 Great Expectations API [`#1025`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1025) [@collado-mike](https://github.com/collado-mike)  
    *Fixes support for custom SQL statements in the Great Expectations provider. (The Great Expectations custom SQL datasource was not applied to the support for the V3 checkpoints API.)*
