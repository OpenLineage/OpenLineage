# 1.9.1 - 2024-02-26

:::important
This version adds the capability to publish **Scala 2.12** and **2.13** variants of **Apache Spark**, 
which necessitates a change in the artifact identifier for `io.openlineage:openlineage-spark`.
From this version onwards, please use: <br/>
`io.openlineage:openlineage-spark_${SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}:${OPENLINEAGE_SPARK_VERSION}`.

    *Adds the capability to publish Scala 2.12 and 2.13 variants of `openlineage-spark`* 

### Changed

    *The 'isReleaseVersion' property was removed from the build, preventing the Flink integration from being released.*

    *`FileConfig` was creating an additional file when not in append mode. Closes [`#2439`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/issues/2439).*
* **Python: fix issue with append option in file config** [`#2441`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2441) [@kacpermuda](https://github.com/kacpermuda)  
    *`FileConfig` was ignoring the append key in YAML config. Closes [`#2440`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/issues/2440)*
* **Spark: fix integration catalog symlink without warehouse** [`#2379`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2379) [@algorithmy1](https://github.com/algorithmy1)

    *In Flink 1.17, the Iceberg `catalogloader` was loading the catalog in the open function, causing the `loadTable` method to throw a `NullPointerException` error.*
* **Spark: migrate `spark35`, `spark3`, `shared` modules to produce Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13 variants** [`#2390`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2390) [`#2385`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2385)[`#2384`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2384) [@d-m-h](https://github.com/d-m-h)  
    *Migrates the three modules to use the refactored Gradle plugins. Also splits some tests into Scala 2.12- and Scala 2.13-specific versions.*
* **Spark: conform the `spark2` module to the new build process** [`#2391`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2391) [@d-m-h](https://github.com/d-m-h)
