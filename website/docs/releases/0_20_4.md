# 0.20.4 - 2023-02-07

### Added
* Airflow: add new extractor for `GCSToGCSOperator` [`#1495`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1495) [@sekikn](https://github.com/sekikn)  
    *Adds a new extractor for this operator.*
* Flink: resolve topic names from regex, support 1.16.0 [`#1522`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1522) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Adds support for Flink 1.16.0 and makes the integration resolve topic names from Kafka topic patterns.*
* Proxy: implement lineage event validator for client proxy [`#1469`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1469) [@fm100](https://github.com/fm100)  
    *Implements logic in the proxy (which is still in development) for validating and handling lineage events.*

### Changed
* CI: use `ruff` instead of flake8, isort, etc., for linting and formatting [`#1526`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1526) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Adopts the `ruff` package, which combines several linters and formatters into one fast binary.*

### Fixed
* Airflow: make the Trino catalog non-mandatory [`#1572`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1572) [@JDarDagran](https://github.com/JDarDagran)  
    *Makes the Trino catalog optional in the Trino extractor.*
* Common: add explicit SQL dependency [`#1532`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1532) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Addresses a 0.19.2 breaking change to the GE integration by including the SQL dependency explicitly.*
* DBT: adjust `tqdm` logging in `dbt-ol` [`#1549`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1549) [@JdarDagran](https://github.com/JDarDagran)  
    *Adjusts `tqdm` to show the correct number of iterations and adds START events for parent runs.*
* DBT: fix typo in log output [`#1493`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1493) [@denimalpaca](https://github.com/denimalpaca)  
    *Fixes 'emittled' typo in log output.*
* Great Expectations/Airflow: follow Snowflake dataset naming rules [`#1527`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1527) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Normalizes Snowflake dataset and datasource naming rules among DBT/Airflow/GE; canonizes old Snowflake account paths around making them all full-size with account, region and cloud names.*
* Java and Python Clients: Kafka does not initialize properties if they are empty; check and notify about Confluent-Kafka requirement [`#1556`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1556) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Fixes the failure to initialize `KafkaTransport` in the Java client and adds an exception if the required `confluent-kafka` module is missing from the Python client.*
* Spark: add square brackets for list-based Spark configs [`#1507`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1507) [@Varunvaruns9](https://github.com/Varunvaruns9)  
    *Adds a condition to treat configs with `[]` as lists. Note: `[]` will be required for list-based configs starting with 0.21.0.*
* Spark: fix several Spark/BigQuery-related issues [`#1557`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1557) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Fixes the assumption that a version is always a number; adds support for `HadoopMapReduceWriteConfigUtil`; makes the integration access `BigQueryUtil` and `getTableId` using reflection, which supports all BigQuery versions; makes logs provide the full serialized LogicalPlan on `debug`.*
* SQL: only report partial failures [`#1479](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1479) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Changes the parser so it reports partial failures instead of failing the whole extraction.*
