# 0.30.1 - 2023-07-25

### Added
* **Flink: support Iceberg sinks** [`#1960`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1960) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Detects output datasets when using an Iceberg table as a sink.*
* **Spark: column-level lineage for `merge into` on Delta tables** [`#1958`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1958) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Makes column-level lineage support `merge into` on Delta tables. Also refactors column-level lineage to deal with multiple Spark versions.*
* **Spark: column-level lineage for `merge into` on Iceberg tables** [`#1971`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1971) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Makes column-level lineage support `merge into` on Iceberg tables.*
* **Spark: add supprt for Iceberg REST catalog** [`#1963`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1963) [@juancappi](https://github.com/juancappi)  
    *Adds `rest` to the existing options of `hive` and `hadoop` in `IcebergHandler.getDatasetIdentifier()` to add support for Iceberg's `RestCatalog`.*
* **Airflow: add possibility to force direct-execution based on environment variable** [`#1934`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1934) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Adds the option to use the direct-execution method on the Airflow listener when the existence of a non-SQLAlchemy-based Airflow event mechanism is confirmed. This happens when using Airflow 2.6 or when the `OPENLINEAGE_AIRFLOW_ENABLE_DIRECT_EXECUTION` environment variable exists.*
* **SQL: add support for Apple Silicon to `openlineage-sql-java`** [`#1981`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1981) [@davidjgoss](https://github.com/davidjgoss)  
    *Expands the OS/architecture checks when compiling to produce a specific file for Apple Silicon. Also expands the corresponding OS/architecture checks when loading the binary at runtime from Java code.*
* **Spec: add facet deletion** [`#1975`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1975) [@julienledem](https://github.com/julienledem)  
    *In order to add a mechanism for deleting job and dataset facets, adds a `{ _deleted: true }` object that can take the place of any job or dataset facet (but not run or input/output facets, which are valid only for a specific run).*
* **Client: add a file transport** [`#1891`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1891) [@Alexkuva](https://github.com/Alexkuva)  
    *Creates a `FileTransport` and its configuration classes supporting append mode or write-new-file mode, which is especially useful when an object store does not support append mode, e.g. in the case of Databricks DBFS FUSE.*

### Changed
* **Airflow: do not run plugin if OpenLineage provider is installed** [`#1999`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1999) [@JDarDagran](https://github.com/JDarDagran)  
    *Sets `OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED` to `true` if the provider is installed.*
* **Python: rename `config` to `config_class`** [`#1998`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1998) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Renames the `config` class variable to `config_class` to avoid potential conflict with the config instance.*

### Fixed
* **Airflow: add workaround for airflow-sqlalchemy event mechanism bug** [`#1959`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1959) [@mobuchowski](https://github.com/mobuchowski)  
    *Due to known issues with the fork and thread model in the Airflow-SQLAlchemy-based event-delivery mechanism, a Kafka producer left alone does not emit a `COMPLETE`` event. This creates a producer for each event when we detect that we're under Airflow 2.3 - 2.5.*
* **Spark: fix custom environment variables facet** [`#1973`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1973) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Enables sending the Spark environment variables facet in a non-deterministic way.*
* **Spark: filter unwanted Delta events** [`#1968`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1968) [@pawel-big-lebowski](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski)  
    *Clears events generated by logical plans having `Project` node as root.*
* **Python: allow modification of `openlineage.*` logging levels via environment variables** [`#1974`](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/1974) [@JDarDagran](https://github.com/JDarDagran)  
    *Adds `OPENLINEAGE_{CLIENT/AIRFLOW/DBT}_LOGGING` environment variables that can be set according to module logging levels and cleans up some logging calls in `openlineage-airflow`.*
