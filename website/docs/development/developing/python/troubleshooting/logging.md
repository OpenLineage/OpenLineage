OpenLineage uses python's [logging facility](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) when generating logs. Being able to emit logs for various purposes is very helpful when troubleshooting OpenLineage.

Consider the following sample python script that emits OpenLineage events:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from openlineage.client.run import (
    RunEvent,
    RunState,
    Run,
    Job,
    Dataset,
    OutputDataset,
    InputDataset,
)
from openlineage.client.client import OpenLineageClient, OpenLineageClientOptions
from openlineage.client.facet import (
    SqlJobFacet,
    SchemaDatasetFacet,
    SchemaField,
    OutputStatisticsOutputDatasetFacet,
    SourceCodeLocationJobFacet,
    NominalTimeRunFacet,
    DataQualityMetricsInputDatasetFacet,
    ColumnMetric,
)
from openlineage.client.uuid import generate_new_uuid

	# optional api key in case the backend requires it
    options=OpenLineageClientOptions(api_key=api_key),
)

# generates job facet
def job(job_name, sql, location):
    facets = {"sql": SqlJobFacet(sql)}
    if location != None:
        facets.update(
            {"sourceCodeLocation": SourceCodeLocationJobFacet("git", location)}
        )
    return Job(namespace=namespace, name=job_name, facets=facets)

            )
        },
    )

def inputDataset(dataset, dq):
    input_facets = {
        "dataQuality": dq,
    }
    return InputDataset(dataset.namespace, dataset.name, dataset.facets, input_facets)


def twoDigits(n):
    if n < 10:
        result = f"0{n}"
    elif n < 100:
        result = f"{n}"
    else:
        raise f"error: {n}"
    return result


now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)


# generates run Event
def runEvents(job_name, sql, inputs, outputs, hour, min, location, duration):

for event in events:
    from openlineage.client.serde import Serde
    client.emit(event)

```

When you use OpenLineage backend such as Marquez on your local environment, the script would emit OpenLienage events to it.

```bash
python oltest.py
```

However, this short script does not produce any logging information, as the logging configuration is not setup.

Add the following line to `oltest.py`, to configure the logging level as `DEBUG`.

```python
...
import logging
...
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
...
```

Re-running the `oltest.py` again will now produce the following outputs:

```

DEBUG will also produce meaningful error messages when something does not work correctly. For example, if the backend server does not exist, you would get the following messages in your console output:

If you wish to output loggigng message to a file, you can modify the basic configuration as following:
```python
...
logging.basicConfig(filename='debug.log', encoding='utf-8', level=logging.DEBUG)
...
```

And the output will be saved to a file `debug.log`.
