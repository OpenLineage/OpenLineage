OpenLineage made an appearance at Data Agility Day 2021, when contributors Julien Le Dem and Kevin Mellott took the virtual stage for a casual conversation about data lineage. The result was both informative and enjoyable.

If you couldn't make the event this year, that's okay! The video is now available, and it's *almost* as good as being there in person.

Julien Le Dem is the creator and lead engineer of OpenLineage. Kevin Mellott implemented the Enterprise Data Platform at Northwestern Mutual, and recently shared [a post detailing his teamâ€™s experiences](/blog/openlineage-at-northwestern-mutual). 

The video is also available at the [Data Agility Day site](https://dataagility.io/october2021/nw-mutual-datakin/), where you can keep an eye out for future events.
