Despite appearing to fit mostly batch processing jobs, OpenLineage provides comprehensive lineage tracking for both batch and streaming job models.

## OpenLineage for Streaming Jobs
In fact, the streaming model can be seen as an extension of the batch model and works effectively with systems like Apache Flink or Apache Spark.
However, there are some core differences between how those jobs are typically executed, and OpenLineage integration has to take into account those differences.

### Understanding Batch and Streaming Job Lineage Differences
For batch jobs, OpenLineage typically aims to answer questions like:
 - Which datasets are read, written to, or updated, and what are their properties?
 - When does the job start and end, and did it succeed?
 - What actual transformations do happen? For instance, which input columns are used to produce which output columns?

In contrast, streaming jobs raise some additional questions:
 - When does an unbounded job end?
 - When are datasets updated?
 - Does the transformation change during execution?

### When Does the Unbounded Job End?

Isn’t streaming supposed to be continuous?
Streaming data is generally defined as being continuously generated, with a clear beginning but no defined end. However, most streaming jobs, even those considered unbounded, do eventually end. For instance:
 - Jobs might need to be upgraded - whether it’s the underlying system or the job itself.
 - Schema changes in the data may necessitate restarting a job.
In such cases, the original run, which refers to a single execution instance of a streaming job, ends, and a new run of the same job begins.
OpenLineage recommends modeling these scenarios as distinct runs, where one run ends and the next begins.
This approach enables OpenLineage consumers to capture key insights.
For example, after weeks of continuous operation, it becomes clear that a streaming job failed to send new data for 30 minutes following a deployment of a new version.
Such visibility is necessary for diagnosing issues and assessing impacts, such as identifying the root cause of delayed data processing.

### When Are Datasets Updated?
Only at the start or end of a job?
Dataset versioning is critical for tasks like debugging and ensuring data freshness. OpenLineage handles dataset updates for batch jobs using two mechanisms:
 - Implicit versioning: The “last update timestamp” corresponds to the end of a run modifying the dataset.
 - Explicit versioning: The DatasetVersionDatasetFacet allows events to provide explicit version details for datasets being read or written.
However, explicit versioning is currently provided only by new “table formats” like Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake, as most systems lack native versioning support in their data storage schemes.
For streaming jobs, OpenLineage offers additional capabilities, as OpenLineage’s RUNNING event type captures information that's available during job execution.
This is particularly evident in OpenLineage's Flink integration, where events are emitted continuously at configurable intervals, including details about completed Flink checkpoints.
Unfortunately, some frameworks
 such as Apache Spark, do not provide detailed updates while the job is still running.

### Does the Transformation Change During Execution?
Certain scenarios in Apache Flink show how transformations can evolve mid-execution.
For example, a KafkaSource configured with a wildcard pattern can dynamically pick up additional topics or partitions during the job’s runtime.
This capability is often used to scale jobs:
In a consumer group, a single partition can be processed by only one consumer, so increasing partitions can address scalability limits.
New topics, representing distinct datasets in OpenLineage, may also be discovered and processed.
If OpenLineage were restricted to emitting events only at the start or end of a job, these new datasets would remain “unclaimed” until the job concluded.
This approach would be an impractical limitation for streaming jobs. With RUNNING events, OpenLineage can transmit updates about new datasets in near real-time, significantly reducing latency.

### Other Concerns
There are other differences between streaming and batch jobs, but, in practice, those are often system-specific rather than general.
OpenLineage facilitates capturing system-specific information by custom facets, which allow you to attach any atomic piece of metadata to OpenLineage core objects.
This provides users with the flexibility to capture unique metadata, system-specific nuances, or operational details.

### Conclusion
In summary, while OpenLineage was initially perceived as a tool primarily for batch job tracking, its robust support for streaming jobs demonstrates its adaptability.
By addressing key challenges such as run boundaries, dataset updates, and dynamic transformations, OpenLineage offers comprehensive lineage tracking for streaming models.
The inclusion of continuous RUNNING events and support for custom facets further enhances its utility in complex streaming environments.
This allows OpenLineage consumers to effectively use events from streaming jobs to achieve greater visibility, traceability, and control over their streaming workflows.
It also facilitates more efficient debugging, impact analysis, and operational awareness.
