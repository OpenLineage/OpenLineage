OpenLineage has achieved Incubation status with the LFAI & Data.

<!--truncate-->

At the December meeting of the LFAI & Data Foundation TAC, members voted to advance OpenLineage to the Incubation stage of their program! This required us to earn a Silver Badge from the [OpenSSF](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en), get 300+ stars on GitHub (we have over 1100), and make an in-depth presentation about the project and our community to the TAC. 

### What It Means

Now that weâ€™ve cleared this hurdle, we have access to additional services from the foundation, including assistance with creative work, marketing and communication support, and event-planning assistance. Graduation from the program, which will earn us a voting seat on the TAC, is on the horizon. Stay tuned for updates on our progress with the foundation. 

### About the LFAI & Data

LF AI & Data is an umbrella foundation of the Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and data. LF AI & Data was created to support open source AI and data, and to create a sustainable open source AI and data ecosystem that makes it easy to create AI and data products and services using open source technologies. They foster collaboration under a neutral environment with an open governance in support of the harmonization and acceleration of open source technical projects.

### What's Next 

The next step for the project is Graduation, which we expect to happen early this summer. Requirements for Graduation include 1000 stars on GitHub and the OpenSSF Gold Badge. Watch this space for updates on our progress.
