At this year's [Kafka Summit in London](https://www.kafka-summit.org/events/kafka-summit-london-2024/about), 
two project committers, Paweł Leszczyński and Maciej Obuchowski, will give a talk entitled 
**OpenLineage for Stream Processing** on March 19th at 2:00 PM GMT.

As the [abstract available on the summit website](https://events.bizzabo.com/559905/agenda/session/1284918) 
says, the talk will cover some of the 'many useful features completed or begun' 
recently related to stream processing, including:

<ul>
<li> a seamless OpenLineage & Apache Flink integration, </li>
<li> support for streaming jobs in Marquez, </li>
<li> progress on a built-in lineage API within the Flink codebase. </li>
</ul>

As the abstract goes on to say,

*Cross-platform lineage allows for a holistic overview of data flow and its dependencies 
within organizations, including stream processing. This talk will provide an overview of 
the most recent developments in the OpenLineage Flink integration and share what’s in store 
for this important collaboration. This talk is a must-attend for those wishing to stay 
up-to-date on lineage developments in the stream processing world.*

Register and attend this interesting talk if you can. And keep an eye out for an 
announcement about a recording if and when one becomes available.

Thanks, Maciej and Paweł, for spreading the word about these exciting developments in 
the project.
