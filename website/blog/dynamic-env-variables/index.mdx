The OpenLineage community has frequently highlighted the need for a more flexible and scalable approach to configuration management, particularly through environment variables.
Many users reported challenges in maintaining separate configuration files across development, testing, and production environments.
In response, the 1.23.0 release introduces dynamic environment variables—addressing these concerns head-on by simplifying the configuration process, 
reducing code changes, and improving security across different environments.


In this guide, we'll explore how to leverage dynamic environment variables to simplify OpenLineage configuration, enhance flexibility, and improve security.

# What's New in 1.23.0

In the upcoming **1.23.0 release** of OpenLineage, we're excited to introduce dynamic environment variables, which will revolutionize the way you configure your OpenLineage client. With this feature, you'll be able to simplify your configuration, improve maintainability, and adapt to changing environments with ease.

# Why Dynamic Environment Variables?

### Flexibility on a Whole New Level
Stop worrying about reconfiguring code or files—dynamic environment variables let you adjust settings on the fly. This feature is perfect for developers, testers, and production environments that demand real-time adaptability.

### Centralized Management at Your Fingertips
With environment variables, you can securely store configuration details alongside other essential application settings. No more scattering information across multiple files—it’s all in one place.

### Cleaner Code, Happier Developers
Say goodbye to the clutter of parsing configuration files in your codebase. Dynamic environment variables lead to cleaner, more maintainable applications, saving you time and headaches.

### Seamless Integration for Effortless Deployment
Dynamic environment variables easily sync with modern deployment tools and practices, ensuring smooth and stress-free configuration management every time.

## When to Use Dynamic Environment Variables

### Development & Testing
Need to experiment with new configurations quickly? Dynamic environment variables let you do just that—without ever touching your code.

### Production Deployments
Keep your production environment secure and organized by managing all configuration settings with ease and efficiency.

### Dynamic Environments
No more manual updates! Easily adapt to rapidly changing environments with this flexible configuration approach.

## Key Features You’ll Love
* **Dynamic Updates**: Modify configurations in real-time without restarting your application.
* **Hierarchical Organization**: Keep your settings clear and manageable with nested sections.
* **Automatic Conversions**: OpenLineage automatically converts variable names to camelCase in Java, ensuring consistency.
* **JSON Support**: Got complex configurations? Embed them directly in environment variables with JSON.
* **Effortless Integration**: Tie your configuration process into deployment tools and scripting languages for smooth automation.


### Quick Setup Example: HTTP Transport Configuration

Let’s see dynamic environment variables in action! Suppose you need to configure your client to send events to an HTTP endpoint with basic authentication. Here’s how simple it is using environment variables:

<Tabs groupId="configs">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java HTTP Transport">

```sh
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__TYPE=http
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__URL=http://localhost:5050
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__ENDPOINT=/api/v1/lineage
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__AUTH__TYPE=api_key
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__AUTH__API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__COMPRESSION=gzip
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python HTTP Transport">

```sh
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__TYPE=http
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__URL=http://localhost:5050
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__ENDPOINT=/api/v1/lineage
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__AUTH='{"type":"api_key", "apiKey":"your_api_key"}'
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__COMPRESSION=gzip
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This translates to the equivalent YAML configuration:

```yaml
transport:
  type: http
  url: http://localhost:5050
  endpoint: /api/v1/lineage
  auth:
    type: api_key
    apiKey: your_api_key
  compression: gzip
```


### Configuring CompositeTransport with Aliases for Ultimate Flexibility

In Python, configuring CompositeTransport is a breeze with aliases for `OPENLINEAGE_URL`, `OPENLINEAGE_API_KEY`, and `OPENLINEAGE_ENDPOINT`.
It allows you to create a default configuration for the default HTTP transport and easily add extra targets.

Here’s an example if you’ve already set the following environment variables:
```sh
OPENLINEAGE_URL=http://localhost:5050
OPENLINEAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENLINEAGE_ENDPOINT=/api/v1/lineage
```

Now, configure the CompositeTransport:
```sh
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__TYPE=composite
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__TRANSPORTS__ANOTHER_TARGET__TYPE=http
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__TRANSPORTS__ANOTHER_TARGET__URL=http://another_host:5050
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__TRANSPORTS__ANOTHER_TARGET__AUTH='{"type":"api_key", "apiKey":"random_token"}'
OPENLINEAGE__TRANSPORT__TRANSPORTS__ANOTHER_TARGET__COMPRESSION=gzip
```

You’ve just configured a CompositeTransport with two targets: `default_http` and `another_target`. The best part? You didn’t have to touch your config files!

### Troubleshooting

Got issues? Here’s how to troubleshoot common problems with OpenLineage configuration:

* **Check Variable Names**: Ensure the environment variable names match what OpenLineage expects.
* **Validate Values**: Double-check that you’re assigning the correct values.
* **Client Permissions**: Ensure your OpenLineage client has access to read the environment variables, especially in containers like Docker.
* **Environment Variable Verification**: Confirm all necessary environment variables are set in the correct environment.

## Wrap up: Embrace Dynamic Configuration

Dynamic environment variables offer a powerful and flexible approach to configuring the OpenLineage client. By leveraging this feature, you can streamline your setup, improve maintainability, and adapt configurations seamlessly within your dynamic environments. Say goodbye to complex configuration files and hello to a more efficient and scalable OpenLineage setup!
