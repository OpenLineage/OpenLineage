Built-in support for custom extractors makes OpenLineage a highly adaptable solution for pipelines that use Airflow.

### Overview 

Airflow is built around operators, each having a different function and requiring a different approach to lineage. The OpenLineage Airflow integration detects which Airflow operators your DAG is using and extracts lineage data from them using extractors.

The community has already authored a number of extractors to support Airflow’s Great Expectations, BigQuery, Python, Postgres, SQL and Bash operators (and more – you can find all the extractors [here](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/airflow/openlineage/airflow/extractors).) Nevertheless, in the course of pursuing lineage, you may find yourself needing to write custom extractors. 

Some teams use custom extractors to automate repeatable work – using the same code from `PythonOperator` across a project, for example. Another common use case is that a team needs to use an operator for which a pre-built extractor does not yet exist. Airflow has literally hundreds of operators. 

Built-in support for custom extractors makes OpenLineage a flexible, highly adaptable solution for pipelines that use Airflow for orchestration. 

### How it works 

As we explain in the OpenLineage [docs](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/airflow/extractor), custom extractors must be derived from the `BaseExtractor` class (import it from `openlineage.airflow.extractors.base`).

Extractors have methods they can implement: `extract`, `extract_on_complete` and `get_operator_classnames`. Either `extract` or `extract_on_complete` is required. The `get_operator_classnames` method, also required, is for providing a list of operators from which your extractor can get lineage.

For example:

```
@classmethod
def get_operator_classnames(cls) -> List[str]:
  return ['PostgresOperator']
```

If the name of the operator matches one of the names on the list, the extractor will be instantiated – using the operator passed to the extractor as a parameter and stored in the `self.operator` property – and both the `extract` and `extract_on_complete` methods will be called. They both return information used by the OpenLineage integration to emit OpenLineage events. The difference is that `extract` is called before the operator's `execute` method to generate a `START` event, while `extract_on_complete` is called afterward to generate a `COMPLETE` event. The latter has access to any additional information that the operator leaves behind following execution. A good example of this is the `SnowflakeOperator`, which sets `query_id`s after execution.

Both methods return a `TaskMetadata` structure:

```
@attr.s
class TaskMetadata:
    name: str = attr.ib()  # deprecated
    inputs: List[Dataset] = attr.ib(factory=list)
    outputs: List[Dataset] = attr.ib(factory=list)
    run_facets: Dict[str, BaseFacet] = attr.ib(factory=dict)
    job_facets: Dict[str, BaseFacet] = attr.ib(factory=dict)
```

The inputs and outputs are lists of plain [OpenLineage datasets](https://openlineage.io/docs/client/python).

The `run_facets` and `job_facets` are dictionaries of optional [`JobFacets`](https://openlineage.io/docs/client/python) and [`RunFacets`](https://openlineage.io/docs/client/python) that accompany a job. For example, you might want to attach a `SqlJobFacet` if your operator is executing SQL.

Note: in order for a custom extractor to work, it must be registered first, so the OpenLineage integration can import it. You can read about how to use environment variables to do this [here](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/airflow/extractor#registering-custom-extractor).

### Example: the RedshiftDataExtractor

In the `RedshiftDataExtractor`, the `extract_on_complete` method parses SQL, obtains task `stats` using the `get_facets` method of the `RedshiftDataDatasetsProvider` class, and returns a `TaskMetadata` instance. We can see usage of a SQL statement, and the connection is provided by an actual operator. 

```
def extract_on_complete(self, task_instance) -> Optional[TaskMetadata]:
        log.debug(f"extract_on_complete({task_instance})")
        job_facets = {"sql": SqlJobFacet(self.operator.sql)}

        log.debug(f"Sending SQL to parser: {self.operator.sql}")
        sql_meta: Optional[SqlMeta] = parse(self.operator.sql, self.default_schema)
        log.debug(f"Got meta {sql_meta}")
        try:
            redshift_job_id = self._get_xcom_redshift_job_id(task_instance)
            if redshift_job_id is None:
                raise Exception(
                    "Xcom could not resolve Redshift job id. Job may have failed."
                )
        except Exception as e:
            log.error(f"Cannot retrieve job details from {e}", exc_info=True)
            return TaskMetadata(
                name=get_job_name(task=self.operator),
                run_facets={},
                job_facets=job_facets,
            )

        client = self.operator.hook.conn

        redshift_details = [
            "database",
            "cluster_identifier",
            "db_user",
            "secret_arn",
            "region",
        ]

        connection_details = {
            detail: getattr(self.operator, detail) for detail in redshift_details
        }

        stats = RedshiftDataDatasetsProvider(
            client=client, connection_details=connection_details
        ).get_facets(
            job_id=redshift_job_id,
            inputs=sql_meta.in_tables if sql_meta else [],
            outputs=sql_meta.out_tables if sql_meta else [],
        )

        return TaskMetadata(
            name=get_job_name(task=self.operator),
            inputs=[ds.to_openlineage_dataset() for ds in stats.inputs],
            outputs=[ds.to_openlineage_dataset() for ds in stats.output],
            run_facets=stats.run_facets,
            job_facets={"sql": SqlJobFacet(self.operator.sql)},
        )
```

### Common issues 

There are two common issues associated with custom extractors. 

First, when the wrong path is provided to `OPENLINEAGE_EXTRACTORS`, the extractor isn’t imported and OpenLineage events aren’t emitted. The path needs to be exactly the same as the one you are using in your code. Also, make sure that the extractor code is available to import from Airflow’s Python interpreter.

Second, imports from Airflow can be unnoticeably cyclical. This is due to the fact that OpenLineage code gets instantiated when the Airflow worker itself starts, in contrast to DAG code. OpenLineage extraction can fail as a result. To avoid this issue, make sure that all imports from Airflow are local – in the `extract` or `extract_on_complete` methods. If you need imports for type checking, guard them behind `typing.TYPE_CHECKING`.
