Becoming a LF AI & Data project ensures that OpenLineage can never belong to a company, or even a group of developers; it belongs to us all.

I am pleased to share that the OpenLineage project is joining the [LF AI & Data foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation) as a Sandbox Project! This is an important step towards the development of an open ecosystem for lineage metadata collection.

The LF AI & Data Foundation provides a vendor-neutral governance structure that can help the project grow broad industry collaboration. Even more importantly, becoming a LF AI & Data project ensures that OpenLineage can never belong to a company, or even a group of developers; it belongs to us all. The license can’t be changed to protect the business interests of a subset of the community. That’s important, because in order to succeed we need a whole lot of software projects - open source and proprietary - to adopt this standard and allow their users to begin collecting lineage metadata.

In the [full announcement](https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2021/07/22/openlineage-joins-lf-ai-data-as-new-sandbox-project/), Ibrahim Haddad, Executive Director of LF AI & Data, writes:

> “We look forward to working with the OpenLineage project to grow the project’s footprint in the ecosystem, expand its community of adopters and contributors, and to foster the creation of collaboration opportunities with our members and other related projects.”
