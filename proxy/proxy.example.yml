### PROXY CONFIG ###

proxy:
  # The proxy source is used to identify the lineage source in the different distribution mechanisms. It can be used in
  # further routing of the lineage events without needing to unpack the event contents. In this example, it identifies
  # that the lineage event has gone through the proxy backend. However, if a different proxy backend is serving each engine
  # that is producing lineage events, this value can be set up to represent the source engine.
