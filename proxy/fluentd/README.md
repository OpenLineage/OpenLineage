# Fluentd and Openlineage

## Why are Fluentd and Openlineage a perfect match?

**Fluentd support is experimental and could be changed or removed in a future release.**

Modern data collectors (Fluentd, Logstash, Vector, etc.) can be extremely useful when designing
production-grade architectures for processing Openlineage events.

They can be used for features such as:
* A server-proxy in front of the Openlineage backend (like Marquez) to handle load spikes and buffer incoming events when the backend is down (e.g., due to a maintainance window).
* The ability to copy the event to multiple backends such as HTTP, Kafka or cloud object storage. Data collectors implement that out-of-the-box.

They have great potential except for a single missing feature: *the ability to parse and validate OpenLineage events at the point of HTTP input*.
This is important as one would like to get a `Bad Request` response immediately when sending invalid OpenLineage events to an endpoint.
Fortunately, this missing feature can be implemented as a plugin.

We decided to implement an OpenLineage parser plugin for Fluentd because:
* Fluentd has a small footprint in terms of resource utilization and does not require that JVM be installed,
* Fluentd plugins can be installed from local files (no need to register in a plugin repository).

As a side effect, the Fluentd integration can be also used as a OpenLineage HTTP validation backend for
development purposes.

## Fluentd features

Some interesting Fluentd features are available according to the [official documentation](https://docs.fluentd.org/):

* [Buffering/retrying parameters](https://docs.fluentd.org/output#buffering-retrying-parameters),
* Useful output plugins:
   * [Output Kafka plugin](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/kafka),
   * [Output S3 plugin](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/s3),
   * [Output copy plugin](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/copy),
   * [Output HTTP plugin](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http) with options such as [retryable_response_codes](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http#retryable_response_codes) to specify backend codes that should cause a retry,
* [Buffer configuration](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/buffer-section),
* [Embedding Ruby Expressions in config files to contain environment variables](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/config-file#embedding-ruby-expressions).

The official Fluentd documentation does not mention guarantees about event ordering. However, retrieving
Openlineage events and buffering in file/memory should be considered a millisecond-long operation,
while any HTTP backend cannot guarantee ordering in such a case. On the other hand, by default
the amount of threads to flush the buffer is set to 1 and configurable ([flush_thread_count](https://docs.fluentd.org/output#flush_thread_count)).

## Quickstart with Docker

Please refer to the [`Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile) and [`fluent.conf`](docker/conf/fluent.conf) to see how to build and install the plugin with
the example usage scenario provided in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker/docker-compose.yml). To run the example setup, go to the `docker` directory and execute the following command:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

After all the containers have started, send some HTTP requests:

```shell
curl -X POST \
-d '{"test":"test"}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
http://localhost:9880/api/v1/lineage
```
In response, you should see the following message:

`Openlineage validation failed: path "/": "run" is a required property, path "/": "job" is a required property, path "/": "eventTime" is a required property, path "/": "producer" is a required property, path "/": "schemaURL" is a required property`

Next, send some valid requests:

```shell
curl -X POST \
-d "$(cat test-start.json)" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
http://localhost:9880/api/v1/lineage
```

```shell
curl -X POST \
-d "$(cat test-complete.json)" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
http://localhost:9880/api/v1/lineage
```

After that you should see entities in Marquez (http://localhost:3000/) in the `my-namespace` namespace.

To clean up, run
```shell
docker-compose down
```

## Deployment on Kubernetes

***Section under construction***

## Parser plugin

Openlineage-parser is a Fluentd plugin that verifies if a JSON matches the OpenLineage schema.

### Configuration

Although Openlineage event is specified according to Json-Schema, its real-life validation may
vary and backends like Marquez may have less strict approach to validating certain types of facets. 
For example, Marquez allows a non-valid `DataQualityMetricsInputDatasetFacet`. 
To give more flexibility, fluentd parser allows following configuration parameters:
```ruby
validate_input_dataset_facets => true/false
validate_output_dataset_facets => true/false
validate_dataset_facets => true/false
validate_run_facets => true/false
validate_job_facets =>  true/false
```
By default, only `validate_run_facets` and `validate_job_facets` are set to `true`/

### Development

To build dependencies:
```shell
bundle install
bundle
```

To run the tests:
```shell
bundle exec rake test
```

#### Installation

The easiest way to install the plugin is to install external packages:
* `rusty_json_schema` installs a JSON validation library for Rust,
* `fluent-plugin-out-http` allows non-bulk HTTP out requests (sending each OpenLineage event in a separate request).
```shell
fluent-gem install rusty_json_schema
fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-out-http
```
Once the external dependencies are installed, a single Ruby code file `parser_openlineage.rb` needs
to be copied into the Fluentd plugins directory ([installing custom plugin](https://docs.fluentd.org/plugin-development#installing-custom-plugins)).
