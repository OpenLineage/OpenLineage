**Integration target:**
please add a URL to the framework/project product to integrate with

**Proposed implementation**
If there is a proposed implementation:

Ideally the target itself implements the OpenLineage API to produce lineage events.
 - If this is the case, link to the other project/product tracker if available.

If we are implementing an integration in OpenLineage:
- have a short design
- please add link to APIs we would use
