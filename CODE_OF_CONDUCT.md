# Code of Conduct

All members of this project agree to adhere to the following Code of Conduct

## Statement of Intent

The OpenLineage project is committed to maintain a **positive** [work environment](#work-environment). This commitment calls for a workplace where [participants](#participant) at all levels behave according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that we all share responsibility for our work environment.
## Code
1. Treat each other with [respect](#respect), professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
1. Never [harass](#harassment) or [bully](#workplace-bullying) anyone verbally, physically or [sexually](#sexual-harassment).
1. Never [discriminate](#discrimination) on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
1. Communicate constructively and avoid [demeaning](#demeaning-behavior) or [insulting](#insulting-behavior) behavior or language.
1. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and [acknowledge](#acknowledgement) properly the contributions of others.
1. Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest.
1. Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access.
1. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or [unwelcome behavior](#unwelcome-behavior) or [advances](#unwelcome-sexual-advance).
1. Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a [leadership position](#leadership-position)) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.
1. Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people.
1. Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go, and the OpenLineage project is no different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off.

## Glossary

#### Insulting behavior
is treating another person with scorn or disrespect.

#### Respect

#### Sexual harassment
includes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault.

#### Unwelcome behavior
Hard to define? Some questions to ask yourself are:
* how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient?
* would my spouse, parent, child, sibling or friend like to be treated this way?
* would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization's newsletter?
* could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group?
* could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing?
* would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that ?

_Summary_: if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don't do it.

#### Unwelcome sexual advance

* submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
* submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual,
* such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating hostile or offensive working environment.
