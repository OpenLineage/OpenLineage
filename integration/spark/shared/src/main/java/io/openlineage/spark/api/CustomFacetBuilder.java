import java.util.function.BiConsumer;

/**
 * Defines the base class for an event consumer that can generate custom facets from those events. A
 * facet builder is like a partial function, which defines an {@link #isDefinedAt(Object)} method
 * that determines whether the function is defined for a given input. If the function is defined,
 * the {@link #build(Object, BiConsumer)} method is invoked with the input object and a {@link
 * BiConsumer} that accepts both the name of the facet and the facet itself. A {@link
 * CustomFacetBuilder} is itself a {@link BiConsumer} whose {@link #accept(Object, BiConsumer)}
 * method implements the logic described.
 *
 * <p>The event types that can be consumed to generate facets have no common supertype, so the
 * generic argument T isn't bounded. The types of arguments that may be found include
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.spark.scheduler.StageInfo}
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.spark.scheduler.Stage}
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD}
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.spark.scheduler.ActiveJob}
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.spark.sql.execution.QueryExecution}
 * </ul>
