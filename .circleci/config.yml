  # Determine the modules that have changed and trigger a series of workflow tasks as necessary.
  # We merge multiple workflows from files in the workflows subdirectory based on the changed
  # modules. A single module changed may require tests and builds in multiple downstream modules.
  # For example, a change to the python client requires building the airflow, common, and dagster
  # modules. Changing the spec requires building everything.
  # Note that we don't use the path-filtering orb because we require this dynamic combination of
  # workflows. The path-filtering orb will let us set some boolean parameters (e.g., airflow: true),
  # but we can't stitch together multiple workflows and create cross-workflow dependencies. E.g.,
  # it's possible to create a workflow for the python client and one for the airflow library, but we
  # can't create an airflow workflow and a python client workflow and have the airflow workflow
  # depend on the python client workflow if both boolean parameters happen to be true. We could
  # simply make each workflow include its dependencies, but then we'll end up with duplicate steps
  # (e.g., if the python client changes it triggers the airflow, common, and dagster modules;
  # including dependencies means that each module would run the python client tests).
  #
  # The workflow files in the subdirectory are yaml files that adhere to the schema of the workflows
  # section of a circleci config.yml file. See the spec here: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
  # In addition, each workflow should include a job called "workflow_complete". This workflow_complete
  # is defined as a no-op job in the continue_config.yml file. The job should have dependencies on
  # each required terminal step in the workflow. E.g., the Java workflow requires the Spark
  # integration test step which is the last required step in the workflow. All of the
  # workflow_complete jobs will be merged together so the final workflow will have a single
  # workflow_complete job that depends on all of the required terminal steps in each executed
  # workflow
